									<h2>Persona</h2>

									<div class="content">

											<p><h3>User Task </h3>Users should be able to quickly decide what to cook based on their ingredients and mood.</p>


											<p><b>Scenario</b><br>
												Peter Pangihutan wants to cook his dinner in PGP after a long and tiring study session in his room.
												 He decides to reward himself by making his favorite spaghetti and meatballs. However, when he opens
												  the communal pantry fridge, he is horrified to see that he has run out of pasta and some other
												   ingredients as well. Left confused on what to cook, he scrounges both his cupboard and refrigerator,
												    trying to come up with a recipe using the ingredients he has left. After wasting a good amount 
													of time contemplating and still not knowing what to cook, he starts getting hungry and impatient.
													 He decides to turn to the internet instead and starts searching online for some quick recipes 
													 using his remaining ingredients. He finally finds a suitable recipe and begins preparing his meal,
													  though by now an entire hour has passed since he first wanted to start cooking. Peter is starving,
													   frustrated that so much time has been wasted, and stressed that he now has 1 less hour to
													    complete his assignment due later that night.

									<div class="content">

											<p><h3>User Task </h3> Users should be able to get suggested recipes on their expiring ingredients.</p>



											<p><b>Scenario</b><br>
												Peter Pangihutan had just come back from a shopping trip to Sheng Siong and was putting the groceries away 
												in the communal pantry in PGP. He had bought some extra leafy vegetables as he was running out of them, and
												 stored them together with the old batch of vegetables. Being thrifty, he had also bought potatoes in the 
												 large discounted bag and took a mental note to use them quickly before they sprout and spoil. Not wanting to
												  eat the same meal multiple times however, he searched online for various recipes using potatoes and started 
												  planning the different recipes for the next few days. <br><br>
												  After a few days of eating every meal with potatoes, Peter starts getting tired of it and deviates from his
												   originally planned recipes. He decides to cook something else that day using the leafy vegetables he had
												    bought earlier. However, when he opened the refrigerator, he realized that some of them had already wilted 
													and spoiled. He had completely forgotten about the old batch of vegetables that he had left, as he got 
													confused with the new batch of  vegetables and thought that the vegetables would expire later. He grumbled 
													about wasting food and money before throwing the spoilt vegetables away. Not wanting to eat more potatoes 
													however, He decides to cook something else entirely with his other ingredients. After another few days of not
													 eating potatoes, the same thing happened where he forgot about them, and they all 
													 expired and had to be thrown away.

									<button type="button" class="collapsible"> <h3>User Task 3</h3></button>
									<div class="content">

											<p><h3>User Task </h3>Users should be able to generate a list of ingredients
												 to buy at the supermarket to ensure they do not miss out on any items.</p>



											<p><b>Scenario</b><br>
												It is another Sunday, and Peter Pangihutan, being a fun loving student, has 
												just finished hanging out with his friends (as they do every week). On his
												 way back to PGP, as usual, he stops by the Clementi Fairprice to purchase 
												 all the ingredients he needs for next week's cooking. His routine trip to
												  Clementi Fairprice on Sundays is his only supermarket trip of the week;
												   making a singular trip saves him traveling time. As always, Peter already
												    has a mental list on what ingredients he needs. He walks down the
													 supermarket aisles, trying to recall the ingredients on his 
													 mental list that he needs to buy.<br><br>
													 
												After 30 minutes of grocery shopping, Peter looks through his basket and is 
												confident that he has everything he set out to buy. He is pleased with the
												 discounted pasta and eggs he managed to find today. After paying for his
												  groceries, he heads back to PGP.<br><br>
												
												  Upon reaching PGP, Peter happily labels his ingredients with his name and
												   places them into the communal pantry fridge. He is excited to finally
												    be able to cook himself the spaghetti and meatballs he has been craving 
													since last week. But then it dawns on him: he forgot to buy the meatballs!
													 He was so confident, but his memory has failed him yet again. His disappointment 
													 is immeasurable as he faces the prospect of another meatball-less week. <br>
